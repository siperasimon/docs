## **Edit Your Question**

Once a type is selected, you’re taken to the question editor. Here’s what you’ll work with:

### **Question Title**

Displayed at the top of the question. Use descriptive titles (e.g. _“GEO100 Autumn 2020 – Ice Age”_) to help with reuse.

### **Preview**

Click **Preview** to see how the question will appear to candidates.

### **Save and Close**

- Click **Save** to save changes without exiting
- Click **Save & Close** to exit edit mode

## **Build the Question**

### **Question Text**

This is the main content area. Use the WYSIWYG editor to add:

- Text
- Math (LaTeX)
- Tables
- Files (including PDFs)
- Images, videos, and audio clips

### **Response Area**

Where candidates enter their answers. The configuration options vary by question type. Click inside the response area to customise it via the right-hand panel.

## **Options and Enhancements**

Available in the right-hand panel when editing question text. Options include:

### **Marks**: Set maximum score or automated marking logic

Set up how the question is scored, depending on its type. Options include:

- Basic or advanced scoring
- Threshold values (for most automatically marked questions)
- Bands and criteria (for Essay and Oral question types)
- Rubrics (for Essay, Oral, Text Area, Upload Assignment, Programming, Math working, and Audio Record)

### **Mark Scheme**: Guidance for graders

Not very good.

### **Main Illustration**: Add a header image or embedded video

Add images or embed videos at the top of the question. Use optimised media to ensure quick loading. Embedded content should be tested across candidate browsers. YouTube embeds are recommended for lockdown tests.

### **PDF Panel**: Attach documents for candidates to reference

Attach a PDF to appear beside the question during the test. Ensure that:

- PDFs do not contain links in lockdown browsers
- An internet connection is available
- PDFs are added to each language version if applicable
- Candidates cannot download the PDF directly (they can use print to PDF if needed)

### **Labels**: Tag questions by subject or topic

Use labels to tag questions with subjects, topics, or usage context. This helps with searching and organising within the question bank.
